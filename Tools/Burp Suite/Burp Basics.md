Burp Suit est utilisé pour pentest les applications web et mobile. Particulièrement utile avec les APIs.
- **Proxy**: The [[Burp Proxy]] is the most renowned aspect of Burp Suite. It enables interception and modification of requests and responses while interacting with web applications.
- **Repeater**: Another well-known feature. [Repeater](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiterepeater) allows for capturing, modifying, and resending the same request multiple times. This functionality is particularly useful when crafting payloads through trial and error (e.g., in SQLi - Structured Query Language Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for vulnerabilities.
- **[[Burp Intruder]]**: Despite rate limitations in Burp Suite Community, [Intruder](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteintruder) allows for spraying endpoints with requests. It is commonly utilized for brute-force attacks or fuzzing endpoints.
- **Decoder**: [Decoder](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) offers a valuable service for data transformation. It can decode captured information or encode payloads before sending them to the target. While alternative services exist for this purpose, leveraging Decoder within Burp Suite can be highly efficient.
- **Comparer**: As the name suggests, [Comparer](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) enables the comparison of two pieces of data at either the word or byte level. While not exclusive to Burp Suite, the ability to send potentially large data segments directly to a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut significantly accelerates the process.
- **Sequencer**: [Sequencer](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuiteom) is typically employed when assessing the randomness of tokens, such as session cookie values or other supposedly randomly generated data. If the algorithm used for generating these values lacks secure randomness, it can expose avenues for devastating attacks.


- **Global Settings**: These settings affect the entire Burp Suite installation and are applied every time you start the application. They provide a baseline configuration for your Burp Suite environment.
    
- **Project Settings**: These settings are specific to the current project and apply only during the session. However, please note that Burp Suite Community Edition does not support saving projects, so any project-specific options will be lost when you close Burp.
