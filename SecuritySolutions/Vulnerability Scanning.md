| The credentials of the subject host must be provided to the vulnerability scanner.                               | The vulnerability scanner does not require the hostâ€™s credentials; it only needs the IP address.                   |
| Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attackers having access to the host.                 | Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host. |
| It provides a deeper visibility into the target system by scanning its configuration and installed applications. | It is less resource-intensive and straightforward to set up.                                                       |
| For example, scanning an internal database by providing its credentials to the vulnerability scanner.            | For example, scanning a public-facing website for vulnerabilities that any user can exploit.                       |
