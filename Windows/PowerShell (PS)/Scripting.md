C'est le fait d'écrire et d'exécuter une série de commande.

Learning scripting with PowerShell goes beyond the scope of this room. Nonetheless, we must understand that its power makes it a crucial skill across all cyber security roles.

- For **blue team** professionals such as incident responders, malware analysts, and threat hunters, PowerShell scripts can automate many different tasks, including log analysis, detecting anomalies, and extracting indicators of compromise (IOCs). These scripts can also be used to reverse-engineer malicious code (malware) or automate the scanning of systems for signs of intrusion.
    
- For the **red team**, including penetration testers and ethical hackers, PowerShell scripts can automate tasks like system enumeration, executing remote commands, and crafting obfuscated scripts to bypass defences. Its deep integration with all types of systems makes it a powerful tool for simulating attacks and testing systems’ resilience against real-world threats.
    
- Staying in the context of cyber security, **system administrators** benefit from PowerShell scripting for automating integrity checks, managing system configurations, and securing networks, especially in remote or large-scale environments. PowerShell scripts can be designed to enforce security policies, monitor systems health, and respond automatically to security incidents, thus enhancing the overall security posture.
