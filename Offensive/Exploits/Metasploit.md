Metasploit est un framework (le plus utilisé), qui couvre toutes les phases de [[Pentesting]].

The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as follows;

- **[[msfconsole]]**: The main command-line interface.
- **Modules**: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
- **Tools**: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. We will cover msfvenom within this module, but pattern_create and pattern_offset are tools useful in exploit development which is beyond the scope of this module.

Afin de commencer a utiliser metasploit on lance la cmd : [[msfconsole]]. La console est l'interface de base pour interagir avec le framework. 

Quelques rappelles :  
[[Exploit]], [[Vulnerability]], [[Payload]].

Un module est un composent de [[Metasploit]] qui s'occupe d'effectuer une tache précise. 
Il sont réparties en différentes catégories : 
- Auxiliary : Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.
- Encoders : Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a [[signature-based antivirus]] solution may miss them. 
- Evasion : While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software. On the other hand, “evasion” modules will try that, with more or less success.
- Exploits
- NOPs 
- Payloads : 
	- **Adapters:** An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which will make a single powershell command that will execute the payload.  
	
	- **Singles:** Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
	
	- **Stagers:** Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
	
	- **Stages:** Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.
- Post : Post modules will be useful on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.


```show options``` permet de voir les paramètres du module.
``set`` permet de régler ces paramètres. 
Parameters you will often use are:

- **RHOSTS:** “Remote host”, the IP address of the target system. A single IP address or a network range can be set. This will support the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (/24, /16, etc.) or a network range (10.10.10.x – 10.10.10.y). You can also use a file where targets are listed, one target per line using file:/path/of/the/target_file.txt, as you can see below.

- **RPORT:** “Remote port”, the port on the target system the vulnerable application is running on.
- **PAYLOAD:** The payload you will use with the exploit.
- **LHOST:** “Localhost”, the attacking machine (your AttackBox or Kali Linux) IP address.
- **LPORT:** “Local port”, the port you will use for the reverse shell to connect back to. This is a port on your attacking machine, and you can set it to any port not used by any other application.
- **SESSION:** Each connection established to the target system using Metasploit will have a session ID. You will use this with post-exploitation modules that will connect to the target system using an existing connection.

**Sessions**  
Once a vulnerability has been successfully exploited, a session will be created. This is the communication channel established between the target system and Metasploit.

  

You can use the `background` command to background the session prompt and go back to the msfconsole prompt.

Alternatively, `CTRL+Z` can be used to background sessions.

The `sessions` command can be used from the msfconsole prompt or any context to see the existing sessions.

To interact with any session, you can use the `sessions -i` command followed by the desired session number.
